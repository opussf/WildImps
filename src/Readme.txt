This is an updated version of: "https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/elvui-wildimps#t1:description" for Legion

This is a simple addon that will track the number of Wild Imps that are currently spawned. Since Demonology relies heavily on these Wild Imps for damage , it's cool to see how many are currently out at any given moment.

This addon will not work unless you are a Demonology spec'd Warlock!
